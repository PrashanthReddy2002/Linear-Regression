**PROJECT TITLE**

PREDICT THE HEART ATTACK DISEASE FOR ORGANISATION "WHO" USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM RATE OF HEART DISEASE WILL BE INCREASING ORDER OR DECREASING MANNER

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

A WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ESTIMATED 12 MILLIONS DEATH RECORDS.ONE OF THEM HALF OF THERE RESULT IS FOUND IN US. THE REASEARCH SCHOLAR POINT OUT THE MOST RELEVANT RISK FACTOR OF HEART ATTACK,AS A DATA SCIENCE ENGINEER PREDICT THE OVERALL RISK USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM CALLED AS LOGISTIC REGRESSION

**TASK**

1.IMPORT THE LIBRARIES,WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PREDICTION.
2.IMPORT THE DATASET, YOUR USING WORKSPACE.
3.USE THE APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OF SKLEARN LIBRARY TO TRAIN,TEST AND SPLIT THE DATASET.
4.FIT YOUR VALUES WITH ARRANGE FUNCTION USING FEATURE SCALING.
5.CHECK YOUR MODEL ACCURACY AND PRECISION USING CONFUSION MATRIX.

**CONCLUSION**

ACCORDING TO THE MODEL ANALYSIS THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM WORK SUCCESFULLY WITH 0.6 ACCURACY SHOWS THAT THE BUILDING THE MODEL SUCCESSFUL.
